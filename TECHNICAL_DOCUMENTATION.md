## Project Context
Create a social media platform, where users can connect, share their experiences, comment on the experiences of others or even make new friends.

## Difficulties Encountered
When downloading pictures, from time to time the picture was double downloaded. The problem was solved by removing an unnecessary check that was only relevant for the development.

When changing the password, the validation of the current password was not happening, allowing any password to change the user's password.

## Future Of The Project
It will be subsequently studied to add the possibility to like and report comments too.

Letting users log in with their Google account will also be considered.
